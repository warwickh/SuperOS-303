// SuperOS-303 - external MIDI clock smoothing (uClock-style, receiver side)
//
// Ported verbatim from SuperOS-606 uclock.h (itself from SuperOS-101
// midiclock.h, the uClock external-sync model, github.com/midilab/uClock).
// The 303 consumes the 24 PPQN stream directly, one engine tick per 0xF8.
// There is no generator side here; the 303's internal clock is the analog
// tempo circuit on the DIN-SYNC CLOCK line, not a firmware timer.
//
// The problem this solves: USB-MIDI clock bytes arrive with several ms of
// host+bus jitter (and in bursts), and stepping the engine on raw arrival
// passes all of it to the CV/gate voice. Tick STRUCTURE stays integer counting (every
// 0xF8 fires exactly one engine tick eventually, so division by counting can
// never drift); only edge TIMING comes from the smoothed timebase: an EMA of
// the tick period plus a gently-pulled phase estimate, snapped when the error
// exceeds half a tick (tempo jump, fresh stream).
//
// Resolution: the timebase is capped at 96 PPQN per the fleet decision (96,
// not 960): phase corrections quantize no finer than a quarter of the 24 PPQN
// tick period, which is all the 303's 24 PPQN engine can consume anyway.
